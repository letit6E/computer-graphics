# Maze problem

### Problem: we need to efficiently solve the online problem of determining possibilities of exiting the labyrinth.

The labyrinth is a set of rectolinear partitions located on a rectangular map. The size of the map is at least $10^6 \times 10^6$, for some points there is an exit to the outside, for others -- not. It is necessary to learn how to most effectively answer the question whether it is possible to exit the maze if we are in cell (x, y).
